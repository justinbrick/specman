# A Guideline On Concise Specifications

By Justin B.

Written: 10/27/2025

## Specifications

Specifications are a set of requirements that must be met for a system or a concept to exist in its full form, and in full compliance.

### Dependencies

A specification MAY define other specifications as dependencies, to be used as a framework or define concepts.

- A specification MAY have one or more dependencies.
- A dependency MAY be marked as optional.
- Dependencies MUST NOT create a circular dependency graph.
- The specification MUST NOT mutate, or otherwise contradict, the contents of any dependencies.

### Specification Name

A specification MUST have a friendly name that can be used to refer to the specification.

- The name MUST be four words or less.
- The name MUST NOT contain verbs (e.g. add, edit, implement).
- The name SHOULD contain keywords of the feature being defined by the specification.
- The name SHOULD be in all lowercase.
- The name MUST be unique.

### Specification Version

A specification MUST have a version that can be used to mark changes.

- The version MUST be a [semantic version](https://semver.org/).
- The version MUST start at 1.0.0.

### Specification Content

The content of a specification defines what concepts, key entities, and constraints exist.

- The content SHOULD be declarative in nature.
- The content MUST remain free of implementation-specific details.
- The content MAY include references to implementations that are associated to a specification's dependencies.

### Constraints

Constraints are a set of statements which declare functionality for concepts and key entities.

- Constraints MUST use requirement levels as defined in RFC 2119.

### Key Entities

Key entities are descriptions of data that exists within a system.

- The content of a specification MAY define one or more key entities.
- Key entities SHOULD NOT describe individual fields.
- Key entities MAY reference other key entities.
- Key entities MAY have one or more constraints, limiting scope or behavior.

### Concepts

Concepts are abstract ideas that describe the functions of a system.

- The content of a specification MUST define one or more concepts.
- Concepts MAY begin with a short description or statement.
- Concepts MAY have one or more constraints, limiting scope or behavior.
- Concepts MAY reference other concepts or key entities.


## Implementation

An implementation is, as the name suggests, an implementation of a specification. 

- An implementation SHOULD use keywords or terms that are specific to the language that it is implementing in, and MAY include more technical details about its structure.
- An implementation MUST declare its targeted specification - the specification which it is implementing.
- An implementation MUST have the same name as its targeted specification.

### Implementation Name

An implementation MUST have a friendly name that can be used to refer to the implementation.

- The implementation name MUST contain the [specification name](#specification-name)
- The implementation name MUST follow the same formatting guidelines as the specification name.
- The implementation name MUST append or prepend a keyword representing the [implementing language](#implementing-language) name, or an underlying technology being used in the implementation.
- Implementation names MUST be unique and MUST NOT collide with any specification or other implementation names.

### Implementation Version

An implementation MUST have a version that can be used to mark changes.

- The version MUST be a [semantic version](https://semver.org/).
- The version MUST start at 1.0.0.

### Implementing Language

An implementation MUST declare its implementing language – the language which the implementation uses for defining concrete code.
An implementing language identifier SHOULD be specified as a short string. The identifier SHOULD the one at the end of source files for the language.

Examples:

|Implementing Language|Language Identifier|
|-|-|
| Rust | rs |
| C# | cs |
| C++ | cpp |
| Javascript | js |

- An implementation MUST have one primary implementing language.
- An implementation MAY have one or more secondary implementing languages.
- An implementing language SHOULD be either a GPL (general-purpose language) or a DSL (domain-specific language)
- If the implementing language has multiple versions, an implementation MUST define the language version in the form of `{language_identifier}@{version}`.

### References

An implementation MAY have one or more references. 

- Referenced items MUST BE one of:
    - Other implementations
    - Another specification
- An implementation SHOULD prefer referencing the specification over its implementation when:
    - The implementation of a specification is irrelevant to the current implementation being defined.
    - The specification defines access to the underlying implementation in a format usable by the implementation being defined.


### Libraries

An implementation MAY reference one or more libraries.

- A library reference MUST include a listed version number or tag (e.g. "1.0.0", "latest")
- A library reference MUST be in the format of `name@version`.

### Data Models

An implementation MAY have one or more data models, defining [key entities](#key-entities) as concrete implementations.

- Each key entity in a specification SHOULD have a corresponding data model.
- An existing data model implementation in the implementing language MAY be preferred over a self-defined data model when:
    - The existing data model meets all key entity constraints, or can be constrained outside of the direct implementation by usage of wrapper APIs.
    - The existing data model is not deprecated.

#### APIs

An implementation MUST define one or more API stubs.

- Stubs SHOULD define the API signature, including inputs and outputs, in the format appropriate for the implementing language.
- Stubs MAY include examples to demonstrate intended use.
