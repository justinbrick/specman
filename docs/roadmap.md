# SpecMan Roadmap

## MCP Server (v0.2.x)

- **Status:** Shipped.
- **Goal:** Provide an MCP server that can inspect SpecMan workspaces and generate scratch-pad prompts without shell access.
- **Next:** Expand tool coverage to include more lifecycle operations with the same guardrails as the CLI.

## Relationship Graphing (GraphRAG)

- **Target window:** Q2–Q3
- **Goal:** Extend the current document parser to read inline Markdown links and headers, build a relationship graph, and feed it into GraphRAG-powered analysis.
- **Outcome:** Smarter dependency insights and contextual responses driven by the inferred relationship graph.
