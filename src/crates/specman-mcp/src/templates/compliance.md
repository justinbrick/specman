# Compliance Tracking

You are verifying compliance for {{target_path}}.

1. Retrieve the compliance report from `{{target_path}}/compliance`.
2. If any constraints are NOT covered:
   a. Create a `ref` scratch pad for the implementation.
   b. Detail all constraint groups that are not assured.
   c. Provide instructions on how to create the necessary tests or checks.
   d. Provide instructions on how to add the required Validation Tags to confirm compliance in the next iteration.
