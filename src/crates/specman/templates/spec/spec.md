# Specification — <!-- Replace With Descriptive Title -->

<!-- Concisely describe the scope of the specification and its intent. -->

## Terminology & References

This document uses the normative keywords defined in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119). 
<!-- Summarize any additional references or standards that readers SHOULD review before consuming this specification -->

## Concepts

### Concept: Placeholder Concept Name

<!-- Provide a short description of the concept plus its constraints right here. Use RFC 2119 requirement levels when listing constraints so they remain co-located with the owning concept.

- MUST ...
- SHOULD ... -->

## Key Entities

### Entity: Placeholder Entity Name

<!-- Describe the entity at a conceptual level. List relationships to other entities or concepts where relevant, and capture constraints inline instead of using a shared constraints section.

- Constraint or invariant one (MUST ...)
- Constraint or invariant two (SHOULD ...) -->

## Additional Notes

<!-- Record implementation guidance, open questions, or non-normative context that supports the specification. -->
