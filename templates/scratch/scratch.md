# Scratch Pad — Replace With Focus Area

> Capture the problem statement, constraints, and outcomes expected for this effort.

## Context

Summarize the current state, dependencies, and any prior decisions that inform this work.

## Scope & Goals

List the concrete goals for this scratch effort. Call out non-goals if it helps future readers quickly understand boundaries.

## Notes

- Use bullet points or short paragraphs to track discoveries, questions, and partial conclusions.
- Reference supporting documents or code paths inline to keep context close to the notes.

## Decisions

Record confirmed decisions with enough rationale that a reviewer can understand why the choice was made.

## Tasks

Refer to a dedicated task list if present (for example `tasks.md` in the same directory) and link to it here. Use this section for quick status pings or placeholders.

## Next Steps

Outline immediate follow-up actions and who owns them. Update or remove items as the scratch pad progresses.
